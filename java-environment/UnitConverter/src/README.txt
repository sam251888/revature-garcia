Created a unit converter that has 3 sub menus in order to conver units from 
miles to feet, grams to pounds, liters to ounces, and feet to meters. 
Functionality is that user selects which he would like to conver to and inputs the
desired quantity. If the user selects quit, then the converter will seize.
